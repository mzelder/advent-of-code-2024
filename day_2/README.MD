This problem wasn't that hard.
Main things to check in any 'report':
- If the whole array is constantly increasing or decresing
- If every next value differ from the previous by at least 1 and at most 3. 

So after checking those 2 values by if's statements we can acknowledge if the 'report' is safe or unsafe.
